# Single Node Injection Attack


This folder maily contains the modified source code for Single Node Injection on GNN. Most modifications are in:

test.py: Additional metrics and args for stats related to our experiments; some args include:

(1): --node_number: number of nodes to be injected

(2): --injection_percentage: upper bound of number of nodes to inject

(3): --initialization: node feature initialization method

(4): --connection: connection initialization method


test.py: Visualizations of the adversiarial attack process; Images are stored in [my google drive] (https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1KKUxiVhgUXbEJn9jaGikYvepsv_BPdoS)
